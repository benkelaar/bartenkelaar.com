			<p>
				I am an enthusiastic software engineer by day and a software
				engineering enthousiast by night.
			</p>

			<p>I have the most experience with Java and the JVM but find that
				for most software engineering problems, programming language is just
				the dialect you speak in the language of solutions.

			<p>
				This site was set up to host a personal project of mine and the original
				site was an experiment with CSS transitions, you can still see it
			  <a href="validation.html">under the Validation header</a>.
		  </p>

			<p>
				The current implementation is a bit of an experimentation with the HTML5
				semantic tags and crafting a nice static page with as little javascript
				as possible. <br />
				It also serves as a location for some articles I would like
				to write to help some of my colleagues and other engineers to better
				comprehend the universe that is the Java Programming Language.

			I work at <a href="http://www.bol.com/">bol.com</a> as a software
			engineer. I'm currently working on the backend application that keeps track
			of stock in several warehouses and communicates the correct information
			about that to the rest of the SOA landscape.
